// Math.random(): A built-in Math method that returns a number between 0 and 1.
// If we want a number between a certain range then we multiply the method with
// a number above the maximum possible number in the range. For example, if we
// want a random number between 0 and 5 then we multiply the method with 6.
// Thus, Math.random() * 6 !!! And it will return us a number between 0 and 5.
// Math.random() returns the numbers in decimal format but we want integer numbers.

// So, there is another very handy JavaScript Math method which is called Math.floor()
// and this method simply removes the decimal part of a number.
// Math.floor(4.8) = 4. Now, we need to use this method on the Math.random() method
// to get an integer number.

// Math.floor(Math.random()*6) = 3. This provides us a random integer number between
// 0 and 5. Now as we want a number between 1 and 6, we will just add 1 to this method
// and it will give us a number between 1 and 6.

// Math.floor(Math.random()*6) + 1 = 6;

// var dice = Math.floor(Math.random()*6) + 1;

// Now, every time we use the variable "dice" it will get assigned a number between
// 1 and 6.
